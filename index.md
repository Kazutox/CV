## EXPERIENCE  

### Software Developer - BSC (Business Science Corporation)
##### July 2019 - Jun 2021, Sandton, SA

- Assisted in the creation of the overarching architecture of the applications that our team would be tasked with building, given the big overlap most of the projects would have, we designed a modular   system that allowed for quick configuration of an application with minimal code reproduction. 

- My first project involved a financial budgeting system for the client, Netcare, that can aggregate to any level of granularity. I engineered a sophisticated system to render the massive amounts of data smoothly and to enable real-time modification, which presented a challenging technical problem. 

- My second project focused internally to re-design the old licensing system that governs the creation of software licenses for customers. It presented a great experience in UX design and optimization. I successfully delivered a system that could enforce company standards upon license applicants and structured an efficient workflow for authorizing and ultimately creating the license for the customer to use.
